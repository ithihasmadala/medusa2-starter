Project Name: 360 Training Demo

Overview:
Rebrand the existing demo site based on our Barrio Coffee project to reflect the 360 Training identity. The site should feature a home page and leverage the existing category pages available at categories.$categoryHandle, rebranded to align with our new visual guidelines.

Scope & Structure:
	1.	Home Page:
	•	Showcase the 360 Training brand with a modern, clear design.
	•	Highlight a few featured courses/products with visuals, brief descriptions, and calls-to-action.
	•	Ensure seamless navigation to the rebranded category pages.
	2.	Rebranded Category Pages:
	•	Utilize the existing category pages (categories.$categoryHandle).
	•	Update the design elements (color schemes, typography, imagery) as per the instructions in our DesignPrompt.md file.
	•	Seed each category with example courses such as:
	•	Business: “Introduction to 360 Training”, “Effective Business Strategies”
	•	Technical Skills: “Modern Web Development”, “Tech Tools 101”
	•	Leadership: “Advanced Leadership Strategies”, “Building Effective Teams”

Design & Branding Guidelines:
	•	Follow the visual and branding guidelines from the DesignPrompt.md file to ensure consistency.
	•	Replace any Barrio Coffee-specific elements with 360 Training content, imagery, and color palettes.
	•	Maintain a minimalistic, user-friendly design that communicates the flexibility and adaptability of the platform.

Additional Notes:
	•	Ensure that the rebranded pages are responsive and optimized for all devices.
	•	Focus on a clean, professional aesthetic that aligns with 360 Training’s brand identity.
