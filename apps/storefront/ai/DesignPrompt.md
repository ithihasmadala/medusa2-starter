Design Prompt: E-commerce Training Courses Website

Create a modern, clean website for an e-commerce platform selling seats for professional training courses. The design should embody a minimalist, intuitive layout with ample white space and clear visual hierarchy to guide users effortlessly. It must be responsive and mobile-first, ensuring seamless usability across devices.

Key elements include:
• Interactive Micro-Interactions: Subtle animations and hover effects to enhance user engagement without distraction.
• Accessible & Trustworthy UI: Use clear typography, high-contrast colors, and intuitive navigation to foster credibility and ease of use.
• Vibrant & Immersive Visuals: Incorporate high-quality images and multimedia previews of training courses to build excitement and illustrate course value.
• Clear Calls-to-Action: Strategically placed CTAs for seat booking and course details.
• Testimonials & Social Proof: Include elements that display user reviews and success stories to strengthen trust.

The overall tone should be inspiring, professional, and inviting—catering to learners seeking to enhance their skills through engaging and reliable training experiences.
